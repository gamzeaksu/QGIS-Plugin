# QGIS Plugin Project

In this project, a python-based plugin has been developed for QGIS. The purpose of the plugin is to find the distance between selected points with different distance metrics. Two different point selection formats are presented to the user in the plugin. In one of these methods, the user selects the points between which the distance should be found from the plugin interface. Second, points are selected via QGIS. Three different metrics are used to calculate the distance between the selected points in the plugin. These metrics are Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance and Chebyshev distance, respectively.
